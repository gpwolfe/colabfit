### Description  
Totaling 4,250 unique carbon structures cultivated from the carbon-24 dataset. Duplicates were identified using StructureMatcher, which allows for improper rotations to find mappings between structures, and as such one of each enantiomorph pair was also removed in the creation of this dataset.
carbon-24_new/train.xyz: 2550 structures  
carbon-24_new/val.xyz: 850 structures  
carbon-24_new/test.xyz: 850 structures  
The following datasets and dataset splits have been cultivated from carbon-24 (Pickard 2020, doi: 10.24435/materialscloud:2020.0026/v1) and from the perov-5 (Castelli 2011
, doi: 10.1039/C1EE02717D; Castelli 2012, doi: 10.1039/C2EE22341D) datasets.
